  <p>Saint Paul Preparatory Seoul (SPPS) DECA Chapter has meetings about an hour every Friday after school. All 7 members are participating in meetings and getting opinions for our future activities. We always record all the meeting agendas. We are planning the activities about 2 weeks so that we do not make any mistakes while we are doing our activities. Also, we frequently communicate through SNS during that preparing weeks. For example, we utilize KakaoTalk to communicate among members. Also, we have our club Instagram account where people are free to come and see our club's photos and activities. Through the Instagram, we advertise our activities such as fundraising. Everytime we are having activities, we make posters for that activity: for example, we make brand new posters every time when we are having a fundraising. We plan all of these through our meetings. During our meeting all the opinions are respected so that all members do not fumble with their opinions. Through having a positive atmosphere of meeting, we are always having efficient and productive meetings.</p>

  <p>Saint Paul Preparatory Seoul (SPPS) DECA Chapter is very active with fundraising for our future. We are the first club in Saint Paul Preparatory Seoul who sold McDonald and Hong-Rui-Zen Sandwich in the 2019-2020 year. Before the fundraising, we always plan which food we are going to sell. After we choose the foods we are going to sell, we calculate how much we are going to earn and spend so that we do not lose money. Through planning, we had never missed any money. Thanks to some people, we were able to earn more than what we expected which allowed us to prepare our activities such as competition. We divided into teams so that each team will have their obligations. For example, one team buys food and comes to school and another team sells. Teams are always changing, meaning one who bought last time sells next time. Through this kind of experience, we started to understand each other better so that we volunteered to come earlier in the morning to buy food. Also, our club is the first club in school which got order through google form. We tried to be more innovative and the result was wonderful. Like this, we are always trying to give little changes. Through that we strongly believe that we will develop once more.</p>
