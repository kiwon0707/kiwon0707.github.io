	<p>Saint Paul Preparatory Seoul (SPPS) DECA Chapter was first founded by president Daniel Hong and co-president Steven Ryu in August 2019. DECA is a decent business club, which would be helpful for students who will major in business, finance, management, entrepreneurs, and marketing. Club activities will make students experience how market and business works. Through those experiences, we improve our skills with selling and managing the club. Also, we learn step by step how the market operates. Chapter is the official club in SPPS, and also the official chapter in DECA organization. All the members in chapter are all officially registered in DECA. Since it is a globally sponsored club, we can participate in DECAâ€™s annual competition, which is held by the official DECA organization. We are having a meeting every Friday after school for planning and getting opinions for our future activities. Mostly, we fundraise for your future activities such as contests. Even though we were a little confused and struggled the first time we started the club, we are getting stable. We are looking forward to our potential development.<br><br><a href="https://www.deca.org/"> More About DECA</a></p>
